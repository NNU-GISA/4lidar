#Lines after '#' is commented
#This is an example file showing rules of specifying an assignment
#The utility should be as below:
  8 10 -4.5    # allow float and negative
abc  12   6    # non-num "abc" is converted to 0
     # if you comment line below, it still works (a 2x3 matrix)
 18    -3  5.138

#The matrix could be square matrix, i.e.,  n X n, 
#if not square matrix, i.e., m X n, then it must be m <= n, i.e., row size <= column size
